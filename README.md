What is Metaverse Game Development?

Metaverse game development involves creating interactive digital environments where players can occupy themselves in a shared virtual space. Different from traditional video games, the metaverse offers a constant world that exists beyond the individual gaming period, often utilising decentralised networks to manage digital assets, avatars, and virtual currencies. This development requires a blend of advanced technologies, including blockchain technology, smart contracts, 3D modelling, AI integration, and more.
